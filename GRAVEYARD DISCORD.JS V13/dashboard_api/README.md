# Dashboard API

This script must be run separately from the bot. The bot just reads the JSON file. 

Python 3 is required to run this script.

## Setup

Make sure you are in the same directory as this README, and run this:

```py
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To deactivate the virtual environment, run this:

```py
deactivate
```
