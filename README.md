# nonsusbot
Discord bot

Run `npm start` in the main directory to run the bot.
Note this will create a background thread for the main script. Use `ps ax` to find it and `kill PID` to kill it, where PID is the number next to the command in `ps ax`.
Edit the `config.json` file to change the bot prefix, bot token, and any api keys.

### Make sure to put your bot token in the config.json file
